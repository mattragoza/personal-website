I am a 1st year PhD student in the Intelligent Systems Program at the University of Pittsburgh School of Computing and Information, where I am advised by Dr. Kayhan Batmanghelich. I am interested in developing methods that enable artificial intelligence to augment the scientific process, both in basic research and important practical applications like drug discovery and medicine. My current approach is to improve the generalizability and interpretability of deep learning models by incorporating prior knowledge and constraints from the natural sciences.
